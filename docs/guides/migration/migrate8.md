### A Error now gets thrown if Debian 10 (or higher) is used with mongodb version below 4.2.0

A Error now gets thrown, if Debian 10 (or higher) is used with a requested mongodb version of below 4.2.0, because there are no version available for Debian 10 below 4.2.0 and Debian 9 binaries are incompatible with Debian 10. (because of libcurl3)
